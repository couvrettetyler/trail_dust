			2016 was the first major backpacking trip that we ever planned. We had our dates set a year prior 
			and began planning every little detail which could be relevant. In order to ensure that everything 
			went as smoothly as possible, we chose a route we had literally done backwards and forward: Mammoth to Yosemite. 
			We began working out the details of our route on printed out satellite images in August of 2015 
			before we eventually got paper maps. After careful counting of miles and elevation change, we marked 
			our new maps with our exact route.
		</p>
		<p class="mx-5">
			We needed to acquire group equipment which we had previously borrowed from Poway Backpackers. 
			This necessitated several fun trips to REI for equipment that ranged from a water bag to an emergency 
			satellite beacon.
		</p>
		<p class="mx-5">
			Our extensive planning enabled smooth securing of permits. At 5:00am, we headed off in a two car caravan. 
			An unfamiliar and exciting start to a familiar route.
		</p>
		<p class="mx-5">
			Our first several days we had some trouble finding the more subtle hidden campsites, 
			but the days were thankfully uneventful. The second half of the trip, however, became more dramatic. 
			When we reached Echo Valley, one of our favorite haunts in Yosemite, we set up camp and were getting 
			ready to swim and cliff jump when a boy scout troop showed up. We figured out how to divide the camp 
			with them and then went swimming.
		</p>
		<p class="mx-5">
			That evening, before dark, three of us climbed up a hillside to explore and enjoy the view. 
			We found the world's most comfortable sand. As it was getting dark we began descending back to camp. 
			We came upon a large log and Shaam jumped down. He heard a sound and turned around to see a rattlesnake 
			just as Ian was to jump. The shouting stopped him just in time. Disaster averted, we made it back to camp 
			and joined the rest by the fire.
		</p>
		<p class="mx-5">
			We sat around the fire playing campfire games. Shortly after dark, Jess pointed to the sky and 
			cried “LOOK!” We all turned up to witness a long bright white streak slowly stretching across 
			the night sky. Three quarters of the way through the sky, we could just see the streak split into two. 
			Shortly after the streak reached the other end we heard a quiet boom. Thinking that a meteor had hit near 
			us, we used guesses about the delay on the sound to estimate the impact site. It later turned out that we 
			had seen a Chinese rocket burning up on reentry over the Western United States. Good thing we did not try 
			to find the nonexistent crash site.
		</p>
		<p class="mx-5">
			The next day, we hiked from Echo Valley to Moraine Dome. As we descended toward little Yosemite Valley, 
			we came upon a burnt out valley. Towering pines had burned, leaving giant columns of blackened charcoal. 
			CCC workers were busy rebuilding the trail and clearing portions of the devastation. Dust and ash drifted 
			through the air and their faces were blackened with a thick layer of soot. In awe of this eerie desolation, 
			few of us could guess at what was still to come.
		</p>
		<p class="mx-5">
			As we made the final descent to the camp below Moraine Dome, the valley below us laid bare; 
			the devastation of the recent fire. What once was a verdant pine forest so grown that you couldn't 
			see five feet off the trail had become a vast field of burned out husks and hot sand. A blast of 
			scorched dry air greeted us as we made our way to camp among the towering black columns which filled 
			the vast graveyard of trees.
		</p>
		<p class="mx-5">
			From Moraine Dome, we launched a climb up the half dome cables to watch sunset from the top. 
			We only had six spots on the Half Dome permit, so Tyler stayed behind to watch the packs. 
			We saw a rattlesnake on the way up and encountered a troop of boisterous Mormon boy scouts at the top. 
			On the way down, Kate saved Ian from a snake. The graveyard proved even creepier at night, but we made 
			it back to camp without further incident. To the delight of the tourists, who perceived us as wildlife, 
			we emerged from the mountains on the Mist Trail. The YARTS bus took us back to Mammoth. We drove to 
			San Luis Obispo that night and then returned to Poway the next day.
