			2017 was our first trip away from our home trails in the Sierras. We wanted to take advantage of our 
			newly expanded options and chose Lassen Volcanic Park where we could explore a wide range of unique features.
		</p>
		<p class="mx-5">
			Traveling to Lassen from San Diego would take long enough that we chose to split our drive up into two. 
			Thus began a brief tradition of stopping in San Luis Obispo at Tyler's home.
		</p>
		<p class="mx-5">
			Shortly before our trip, wolves were seen in Lassen, the first wolf sighting in California in nearly a 
			hundred years. In Lassen, it quickly became clear why wolves might be interested in the park. 
			The park was teaming with the boldest deer we had ever encountered. Over the course of the trip, 
			they came after our food, walked up to us to pee in our water source while making eye contact, 
			and even once encircled us closing in as the darkness settled.
		</p>
		<p class="mx-5">
			This trip was our first trial of our now standard trip planning method of marking points of interest 
			and then linking together as many as possible. On this trip, we took full advantage of Lassen’s volcanism. 
			In addition to exploring large lakes and a towering waterfall, we examined sulfurous hot springs and climbed 
			the cinder cone volcano creatively known as Cindercone.
		</p>
		<p class="mx-5">
			Cindercone was a conical pile of dark black pumice rocks. We crossed the black field of loose pumice 
			the day before and were greeted with the field’s scorching heat. The day of the climb, we began our 
			day before sunrise. Climbing the volcano proved taxing. For every step forward you would immediately slide 
			back half a step in the loose pumice pebbles. Finally we reached the tip shortly after the sun had risen. 
			Even the first light of day was enough to warm the rocks significantly. Inside the caldera we could actually 
			feel the points where the sun had not yet touched!
